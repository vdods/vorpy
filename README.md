# vorpy

A Python package for (usually math-related) code that I've written that finds use over and over.

Vorpy is short for "VictOR dods' PYthon package".  Plus, if you Google "vorpy", you come up with some pretty [hilarious](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vorpy) [shit](http://vorpycrill.bandcamp.com/releases).

-	`symbolic.py` : A module which eases use of `sympy`, facilitating the use of vector/tensor calculus (via `numpy.ndarray`s of symbols),  and which allows compilation of symbolic functions into Python code, caching the generated code if desired.  That process is known as 'lambdification' in `sympy`.  Take a look at the `cached_lambdified` function within this source.
-	Other stuff to be listed later; `symbolic.py` is the gem of this package.
